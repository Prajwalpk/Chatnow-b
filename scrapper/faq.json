        "answer": "\n\n\nIf you have never applied or had any form of credit in the past, you probably won’t have a credit score, although the majority of people do. It is common for those under 18 not to have a credit score as they would have needed to have had a credit card, personal loan, or a utility account in their name, which they wouldn’t normally get until they leave home or in some cases – as with some personal loans – they would not be eligible until turning 21.\n\n\n"

We are unable to provide credit scores to people who we are unable to identify and verify. Sometimes, we will be unable to verify your identity due to mismatches between your identity information and what is checked. In these cases, unless you are able to submit another identity document, you will be unable to obtain your credit score with NOW FINANCE. If you believe the information held on you to be incorrect then you should contact the relevant credit bureau. For security reasons we limit the number of identity verification attempts per person before we lock further access, in order to safeguard both ourselves and consumers against fraud.\n\n\n"

The comparison rate includes the base interest rate, as well as any loan fees and charges, to give you a single percentage rate that you can use to assess loans from different providers. Ensure you use the comparison rate as your benchmark when shopping around for personal loans, and avoid choosing a specific provider based purely on the base interest rate as you may not know what additional costs and fees you will be subject to.\n\n\n"

        "answer": "\n\n\nA secured loan is secured against an asset that you own. This will be your car or other vehicle that can be registered as security against the loan. When you take out a secured loan you are using this asset as collateral should you fail to meet your loan repayments. For example, should you default on your secured loan repayments, as part of the agreement your loan provider may take possession of the security you offered before signing the contract. Due to these loans being secured against assets, consumers can often borrow more at a lower interest rate in comparison to an unsecured loan. An unsecured loan is simply a personal loan that is not secured against an asset. Unsecured loans are usually offered at lower borrowing amounts and with a higher interest rate.\n\n\n"

The second step is to manage your finances to ensure that your funds will be in the bank so that the payments can be taken. If your financial circumstances change at any point during your loan term, you should speak to your personal loan provider, who will discuss your options with you.

Debt consolidation is the practice of using a new personal loan, or another product, to pay all of your current debts, thus consolidating your debt commitments to one place. Bankruptcy is when a consumer cannot meet their debt obligations and files a debtors petition with the Australian Financial Security Authority to be declared bankrupt, or when creditors whom are owed at least $5,000 file a creditors petition in a court, having been unable to come to another form of debt settlement.\n\n\n"
