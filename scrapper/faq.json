If you are looking for a personal loan and decide to apply for numerous personal loans at once, this will affect your ability to be approved, as lenders will look at your credit file and see these repeat applications. Lenders see repeat applications as a consumer having an urgent need for credit, and this can act as a red flag leading to loan applications being declined."

Applying for many different personal loans in a short period is likely to lead to you being offered increasingly higher interest rates and potentially your applications being declined. Instead of shopping around for personal loans by applying for several at once, do your research prior to applying, including checking your credit file is correct, and only apply for one loan. At NOW FINANCE you can get your interest rate before applying for a personal loan without affecting your credit score."

Some personal loan companies will often advertise a low interest rate to make a loan seem attractive and to tempt you to apply, however when you receive your loan offer the interest rate you receive may be far higher than the one on the advert. Personal loan companies are required by law to show the comparison rate if they show an interest rate on any advertising or marketing.  So look out for this if applying for a loan online, and remember with NOW FINANCE you can get your interest rate before you proceed to an application with no impact on your credit score."
